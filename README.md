## :bookmark: About

<strong>Moveit</strong> is a web application that helps to keep healthy while programming.

This application was made during the <strong>Next Level Week</strong> promoted by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/). 
The app was made to help people to combine health and work. It sets 25 minutes to focus on your code, or any office task, but also remembers you to have a break and perform a quick exercise to keep you healthy while working on a computer!
